 This pie chart uses D3 version 5.40 and adds a shadowed panel that collapses upon changing the focused pie slice arc. There are several color palettes that I already added and they are near the 'color' variable that initializes the color scheme. Each animated description box has a header and a paragraph description and the text changes to include a percentage amount that makes up each percent of the pie for that slice and it rounds to a decimal value.  Most importantly, the chart and description box are fully responsive and fit on any screen, tablet, or mobile device. The pie chart will be stacked on top of the panel on a smaller tablet or mobile device and fit accordingly based on the width of the viewport.
